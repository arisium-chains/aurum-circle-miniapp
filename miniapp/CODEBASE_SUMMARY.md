## ML Model Integration

The app uses a hybrid approach with real ML models and simulated fallbacks:

1. **Real ML Mode**:
   - Face detection using MediaPipe
   - Face embedding extraction with ArcFace
   - Quality validation based on frontality, symmetry, and resolution

2. **Simulated Mode**:
   - Fallback system when real models are unavailable
   - Useful for development and testing
   - Defaults to simulated mode for stability

## Scoring System Details

### Attractiveness Scoring Engine
- Processes face images and assigns percentile-based scores (0-100)
- Uses vector similarity matching against existing user base
- Generates vibe tags based on facial characteristics
- Includes confidence metrics based on face quality and dataset size

### Final Score Calculation
- Combines three components:
  1. Facial Attractiveness Score (0-100)
  2. University Ranking Score (0, 5, 10, or 20 points)
  3. NFT Tier Bonus (0, 3, 5, 10, or 15 points for males only)
- University Rankings:
  - Top tier (20 points): Chulalongkorn University, Mahidol International College, Thammasat Rangsit, Siriraj Hospital (Mahidol)
  - Mid tier (10 points): Kasetsart University, KMUTT, Srinakharinwirot University, Silpakorn University, TU Tha Prachan
  - Lower tier (5 points): Bangkok University, Rangsit University, Sripatum University, Assumption University (ABAC)
- NFT Tier Bonuses (for male users):
  - None: 0 points
  - Basic: 3 points
  - Rare: 5 points
  - Elite: 10 points
  - Legendary: 15 points

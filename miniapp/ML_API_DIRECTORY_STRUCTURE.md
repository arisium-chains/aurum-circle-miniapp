# ML API Directory Structure

## Required Directories

To fix the Docker Compose error and make the deployment production-ready, we need to create the following directories:

1. `aurum-circle-miniapp/ml-face-score-api/temp` - For temporary files processing
2. `aurum-circle-miniapp/ml-face-score-api/models` - For ML model files

## Purpose

These directories are mounted as volumes in the Docker Compose configuration:

- `temp` directory is used for processing temporary files
- `models` directory is used for storing ML model files

## Implementation Plan

1. Create the directories
2. Add .gitkeep files to ensure they're tracked in git
3. Update the Docker Compose configuration to properly reference these directories
4. Implement proper model management for production deployment

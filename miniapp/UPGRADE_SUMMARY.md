- Modified validation logic to allow re-scoring of expired scores
- Updated `UserProfile` interface to include `scoreExpiry` field

## ✅ API Improvements

### Rate Limiting Middleware
- Created `rateLimitMiddleware` for API protection
- Applied to `/api/attractiveness/score` endpoint (10 requests/minute/IP)
- Returns 429 status for rate-limited requests

### Enhanced `/api/score` Endpoint
- Updated response format to include score components
- Added caching of calculated scores
- Return structure now includes:
  ```json
  {
    "score": 94,
    "percentile": 96,
    "components": {
      "facial": 78,
      "university": 10,
      "nft": 5
    }
  }
  ```

### `POST /api/ai/score-log` Endpoint
- New endpoint for logging interpreted scores
- Secured with API key validation
- Stores logs in Redis with timestamped keys

## ✅ Security Enhancements

### Tokenized Image Upload URL
- Pre-sign image upload URLs with 5-minute expiration
- Prevents public misuse of upload endpoints
- Implementation planned for future release

### AI Middleware Protection
- Created `aiMiddleware` for protecting AI routes
- Validates `x-api-key` header for all `/api/ai/*` routes
- Allows unrestricted access in development mode

## ✅ Mobile UX Polish

### Facial Upload Guide Overlay
- Created step-by-step guide with positioning, lighting, and expression tips
- Implemented as `FacialUploadGuide` React component
- Uses framer-motion for smooth animations

### Score Reveal Animation
- Built `ScoreReveal` component with animated badge and confetti
- Added special effects for top-tier scores (90+)
- Uses spring physics for natural animations

## ✅ Long-Term Extensibility

### Modularized ML Logic
- Created `ScoreEngine` abstraction interface
- Implemented `TensorFlowScoreEngine` and `LLMScoreEngine` classes
- Added `ScoreEngineFactory` for creating engine instances

### Abstract NFTProvider.ts
- Built chain-agnostic NFT verification system
- Supports Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain, and Zora
- Created provider classes for each chain with factory pattern

## ✅ Deployment & DevOps

### Docker & Docker Compose
- Created multi-container `docker-compose.yml`:
  - Main API service
  - Scoring engine worker
  - Redis for caching and queues
  - Qdrant for vector storage
- Updated Dockerfiles for standalone builds
- Enabled Next.js standalone output mode

### Environment Configuration
- Documented all environment variables in `ENVIRONMENT.md`
- Added support for Redis and Qdrant configuration
- Defined production vs development settings

## ✅ Documentation Updates

### README.md
- Added Docker setup instructions
- Updated tech stack and feature list
- Revised development status with all new features

### CHANGELOG.md
